# Open-Sourcefy Development Status

## Current Reality Check
- **Overall Quality**: 66.5% (+20% from Phase 3 completion)
- **Code Quality**: 30% (Phase 2 target)
- **Analysis Accuracy**: 60% (+20% from Phase 3 completion)
- **Agent Success Rate**: 16/16 agents working (Phase 3 completed)

## Active Development Plan
See [DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) for the current 4-phase parallel execution strategy targeting 95%+ quality.

# Output Directory Structure Configuration

## Summary of Changes

All output from open-sourcefy will now be organized in structured subdirectories under `output/` (or whatever directory is specified via `--output-dir`).

## Directory Structure

```
output/
├── agents/          # Agent-specific analysis outputs  
├── ghidra/          # Ghidra decompilation results and projects
├── compilation/     # Compilation artifacts and generated source
├── reports/         # Pipeline execution reports and summaries
├── logs/            # Execution logs and debug information
└── temp/            # Temporary files (auto-cleaned)
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Hardcoded Paths
- **Before**: Ghidra path was hardcoded to `/mnt/c/Users/pascaldisse/Downloads/open-sourcefy/ghidra`
- **After**: Uses relative path resolution from project root (`Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / "ghidra"`)

### 2. Added Output Structure Configuration
- New `OUTPUT_STRUCTURE` configuration dict defines subdirectory organization
- New `ensure_output_structure()` function creates organized directories
- Pipeline now uses structured paths via `output_paths` context variable

### 3. Updated Pipeline Behavior
- Reports are now saved to `output/reports/pipeline_report.json` instead of root output directory
- Agent context includes `output_paths` for organized file placement
- All temporary and working directories respect the output structure

### 4. Enhanced CLI
- Updated help text clarifies that results are organized in subdirectories
- Default output directory remains `"output"` but with better organization

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Default structured output to output/
python3 main.py launcher.exe

# Custom output directory with same structure
python3 main.py launcher.exe --output-dir my_analysis

# Results will be organized as:
# my_analysis/
# ├── agents/
# ├── ghidra/  
# ├── compilation/
# ├── reports/
# ├── logs/
# └── temp/
```

## Benefits

1. **Organization**: Clear separation of different types of output
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new output categories
3. **Portability**: No hardcoded absolute paths
4. **Cleanliness**: Prevents output file clutter in root directory
5. **Compatibility**: Works with existing agent system and Ghidra integration

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing scripts that expect output files in the root output directory should be updated to look in the appropriate subdirectory (mainly `reports/` for pipeline reports)
- Agent implementations should use the `output_paths` from context rather than creating their own subdirectories

## Implementation Notes

The output structure is created automatically when any pipeline operation runs. Individual agents can access structured paths via the execution context:

```python
# In agent implementations:
output_paths = context.get('output_paths', {})
agent_dir = output_paths.get('agents', context['output_dir'])
ghidra_dir = output_paths.get('ghidra', context['output_dir'])
```

This ensures all output remains properly organized under the main output directory structure.
