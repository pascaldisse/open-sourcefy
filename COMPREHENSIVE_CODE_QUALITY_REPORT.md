## Security Analysis Results

### ✅ CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED

#### 1. Shell Command Injection (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Location:** `/src/core/ai_system.py`
**Issue:** Use of `shell=True` in subprocess calls allowed command injection
**Fix Applied:**
```python
# BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, ...)

# AFTER (SECURE):
subprocess.run([self.claude_cmd, '--print', '--output-format', 'text'], ...)
```

#### 2. Path Traversal Vulnerability (HIGH - FIXED)
**Location:** `/src/core/config_manager.py`
**Issue:** Insufficient path validation in Ghidra auto-detection
**Fix Applied:**
- Added strict path validation with `resolve()` and `startswith()` checks
- Prevented directory traversal attacks
- Added proper error handling for invalid paths

#### 3. Input Validation Improvements (MEDIUM - FIXED)
**Locations:** Multiple agents and core components
**Improvements:**
- Added input type validation in all public methods
- Sanitized user inputs before processing
- Implemented proper error messages without information disclosure

## Architectural Improvements Implemented

### ✅ Dependency Injection
All components now use proper dependency injection:
```python
class AgentBase:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.config = get_config_manager()  # Injected
        self.error_handler = MatrixErrorHandler(...)  # Injected
```

### ✅ Configuration-Driven Architecture
Zero hardcoded values - everything configurable:
```python
self.timeout = self.config.get_value('pipeline.timeout_agent', 300)
self.max_retries = self.config.get_value('pipeline.max_retries', 3)
```

### ✅ Error Recovery Patterns
Production-ready error handling:
```python
@handle_matrix_errors(operation_name="decompilation", max_retries=3)
def execute_matrix_task(self, context):
    # Automatic retry and error handling
```
