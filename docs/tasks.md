# Matrix Pipeline Tasks - Advanced Unpacking Implementation

**Project**: Open-Sourcefy Matrix Pipeline  
**Target**: launcher.exe (5,267,456 bytes) - Custom Packer Analysis & Real Code Extraction  
**Current Status**: Placeholder code generation due to custom packer blocking static analysis  
**Last Updated**: June 12, 2025 - Advanced Unpacking Research Implementation

## 🎯 CRITICAL DISCOVERY - The Packer Limitation

Research reveals that launcher.exe uses a custom packer that prevents static analysis, blocking access to the real code and limiting decompilation to placeholder implementations.

### 📊 Current System Status
- ✅ **Packer Detection**: Successfully identifies custom packer (confidence: 0.30)
- ✅ **UPX Integration**: Complete implementation but binary not UPX-packed
- ✅ **Function Detection**: 1 function detected (unpacker stub only)
- ✅ **Source Generation**: Placeholder C code generated and saved to disk
- ✅ **Pipeline Flow**: All 17 agents execute correctly with dependencies fixed

### 🚨 THE FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION
**Problem**: Custom packer hides ~99% of executable code  
**Current**: 1 function detected from 5.3MB binary (unpacker stub only)  
**Root Cause**: Static analysis cannot penetrate custom packer compression/encryption

## 🏗️ THE PROVEN PATH TO REAL CODE EXTRACTION

Based on external research and advanced unpacking methodologies, here's the phased approach to overcome the packer limitation:
