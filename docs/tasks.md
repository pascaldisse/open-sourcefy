## üö´ Removed Completed Tasks

The following have been removed as they are already implemented:
- Agent framework development (all 17 agents exist)
- Basic Ghidra integration (implemented)
- Configuration management system (operational)
- CLI interface development (complete)
- Core pipeline orchestrator (implemented)
- Matrix-themed architecture (established)

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Verify environment
python3 main.py --verify-env

# Test single agent
python3 main.py --agents 1

# Test agent range
python3 main.py --agents 1-4

# Full pipeline dry run
python3 main.py --dry-run

# Debug mode execution
python3 main.py --debug
```

## üìù Notes

This task list focuses on realistic, achievable goals based on the current implementation state. Previous versions contained significant exaggerations about system capabilities and completion status. This version provides an honest assessment of what exists and what needs to be done to achieve a production-ready binary decompilation system.
