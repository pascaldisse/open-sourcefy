## Execution Flow

```
Deus Ex Machina (Agent 0) initializes Matrix and prepares context
                    â†“
All 16 agents execute independently in parallel:

Discovery Phase:    Sentinel, Mainframe
Analysis Phase:     Agent Program, Virus Scanner, The Architect
Processing Phase:   Diff Engine, Disassembler, Resource Loader
Generation Phase:   Code Generator, Build System
Validation Phase:   The Oracle, Linker, Security Agent
Quality Phase:      Code Optimizer, Quality Analyzer
Testing Phase:      Test Runner
```

This naming scheme provides intuitive understanding while maintaining the Matrix cyberpunk aesthetic. Each agent name directly relates to its function in a way that would make sense in the Matrix universe.
