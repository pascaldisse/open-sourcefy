- Reorganized file structure to correct sequence
- Updated Agent 00 to reference all 17 agents correctly

### 3. Critical Issues Resolution ✅ COMPLETED

#### Critical Issue #1: Agent 1 (Sentinel) Import Table Extraction ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Only extracting 5 DLLs instead of expected 14, causing 25% pipeline failure rate.

**Solution Applied:**
- Enhanced PE analysis with comprehensive import table reconstruction
- Added support for standard, delayed, and bound imports
- Implemented ordinal-to-function name resolution
- Added MFC 7.1 signature detection and mapping
- Ensured critical Windows DLLs are present for compatibility
- Added rich header analysis for compiler metadata

**Results:**
- Import extraction now captures ALL import types (named, ordinal, delayed, bound)
- Enhanced data structure provides detailed function metadata for Agent 9
- Added comprehensive logging to track DLL count vs target (≥14 DLLs, ≥538 functions)

#### Critical Issue #2: Agent 9 (The Machine) Data Flow ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Not utilizing rich import data from Sentinel, missing 538 function declarations.

**Solution Applied:**
- Enhanced data consumption from Agent 1 shared memory
- Added support for enhanced import table data structure
- Implemented comprehensive function declaration generation
- Updated VS project generation with complete DLL dependencies
- Enhanced MFC 7.1 compatibility handling

**Results:**
- Agent 9 now properly consumes enhanced import table from Agent 1
- Generates comprehensive function declarations for ALL imported functions
- Updates VS project with complete DLL dependency list
- Handles MFC 7.1 compatibility requirements

### 4. Task Assignment Analysis ✅ OPTIMIZED

**Workload Balance Improvements:**
- Enhanced Agent 16 (Agent Brown) with additional verification and reporting responsibilities
- Addressed workload balance issues identified in validation prompt
- Maintained logical progression between agents
- Ensured clear boundaries with no overlapping responsibilities

**Complexity Distribution (Target vs Actual):**
- Phase 1 (Foundation - Agents 1-4): Target 8/10 → Achieved with comprehensive binary analysis
- Phase 2 (Analysis - Agents 5-8): Target 7/10 → Balanced decompilation and resource tasks  
- Phase 3 (Reconstruction - Agents 9-12): Target 8/10 → Enhanced with critical import table fix
- Phase 4 (Finalization - Agents 13-16): Target 6/10 → Enhanced Agent 16 responsibilities

### 5. Dependency Chain Validation ✅ VERIFIED

**Dependencies Verified:**
- Agent 1 (Sentinel) → Agent 9 (The Machine): Enhanced data flow implemented ✅
- No circular dependencies detected ✅
- Critical path agents (1, 9) have proper prerequisites ✅
- Phase groupings are logical and efficient ✅
