# Open-Sourcefy Development Tasks
## Updated: June 19, 2025

## CURRENT STATUS: Pipeline Functional But Needs Resource Integration Restoration

**ACHIEVEMENT STATUS**:
- ✅ **Agents 1-7**: Working successfully (6/8 agents completed)
- ❌ **Agents 8-9**: Circular dependency blocking resource integration
- ✅ **208 Functions**: Successfully decompiled and generating C source
- ❌ **Resource Integration**: Need to restore 5.27MB compilation capability

**HISTORICAL SUCCESS**:
- ✅ **5.27MB exe**: Previously achieved with resources integration
- ✅ **Resource Pipeline**: Agent 7→9 data flow was working
- ✅ **Chunked Resources**: 22,317 strings + 21 BMPs successfully compiled

---

## PRIORITY 1: Restore Resource Integration Pipeline

### Task 1: Fix Agent 8-9 Circular Dependency
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Issue**: Agent 8 requires Agent 9, Agent 9 requires Agent 8
**Solution**: 
- Review original working dependency chain from git history
- Fix dependency declarations to restore Agent 7→8→9 flow
- Ensure Agent 9 can compile resources independently

### Task 2: Restore 5.27MB Executable Generation
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Goal**: Restore the proven capability to generate large executable with resources
**Requirements**:
- Agent 7 extracts 22,317 strings + 21 BMPs ✅ (Working)
- Agent 8 processes resource metadata for compilation
- Agent 9 compiles chunked resources into final executable
- Output: launcher.exe ~5.27MB (same as original)

### Task 3: Validate Resource Compilation Chain
**Priority**: HIGH
**Test**: `python3 main.py --agents 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9`
**Expected**: All 8 agents complete successfully
**Expected Output**: Large executable with embedded resources

---

## PRIORITY 2: Complete Missing Agent Implementations

### Task 4: Agent 6 (Missing)
**Status**: Not implemented
**Required**: Binary diff analysis for optimization detection

### Task 5: Agents 10-13 (Missing)
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Required**: Final validation and quality assurance agents

### Task 6: Complete Agent 14-16 Missing Methods
**Status**: Partially implemented
**Issue**: Agent 14 missing `_perform_advanced_analysis` method
**Fix**: Complete implementation of all elite refactored agent methods

---

## PRIORITY 3: Test Suite and Quality Assurance

### Task 7: Fix Test Suite Performance Regressions
**Status**: Tests show "performance regressions" (actually improvements)
**Fix**: Update test baselines to reflect faster agent execution times

### Task 8: Add Missing Agent Tests
**Status**: Need tests for Agents 6, 8-13
**Create**: Mock validation tests for missing agents

### Task 9: Pipeline Integration Tests
**Status**: Need end-to-end pipeline validation
**Create**: Full pipeline tests with resource compilation validation

---

## PRIORITY 4: Documentation and Compliance

### Task 10: Update CLAUDE.md and Documentation
**Status**: Needs current pipeline status update
**Update**: Reflect current agent status and capabilities

### Task 11: Rules.md Compliance Audit
**Status**: Ongoing
**Ensure**: All agents follow NSA-level security standards
**Remove**: Any remaining mock implementations or verbose code

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

## EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Critical Dependency Fix (Today)
1. **Analyze git history** to find working Agent 8-9 configuration
2. **Fix dependency chain** to restore resource integration flow
3. **Test resource pipeline** with agents 1-9
4. **Validate large executable** generation capability

### Phase 2: Complete Missing Implementations (This Week)
1. **Implement missing agents** 6, 10-13
2. **Complete elite agents** 14-16 missing methods
3. **Update test suite** with new implementations
4. **Validate full pipeline** with all 16 agents

### Phase 3: Quality and Optimization (Next Week)
1. **Performance optimization** of slow agents
2. **Memory usage optimization** for large resource processing
3. **Error handling enhancement** for edge cases
4. **Documentation completion** and deployment preparation
