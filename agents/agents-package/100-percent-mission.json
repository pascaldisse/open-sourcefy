YOUR MISSION IS NOT COMPLETE. 99.6% is FAILURE. You MUST achieve 100% functional identity.\n\nCURRENT STATUS - MATRIX PIPELINE RESULTS:\n- Original size: 5,267,456 bytes\n- Reconstructed size: 5,214,781 bytes  \n- Missing: 52,675 bytes (exactly 1.0000%)\n- Hash match: 0% (CRITICAL - need 100%)\n- Functional identity: 99.6% (INSUFFICIENT - need 100%)\n\nTARGETED MISSION OBJECTIVES FOR 52,675 BYTE RECOVERY:\n1. PE SECTION PADDING & ALIGNMENT: Fix section boundaries and padding algorithms\n2. DEBUG/METADATA SECTIONS: Reconstruct missing debug information and metadata\n3. RESOURCE LAYOUT DIFFERENCES: Perfect resource section structure and layout\n4. COMPILER-SPECIFIC ARTIFACTS: Reproduce exact compiler output including signatures\n5. CERTIFICATE/SIGNATURE SECTIONS: Reconstruct any missing authentication data\n\nPRECISION TARGETING PROTOCOL:\n- Agent 1: Validate PE structure byte-by-byte for section alignment issues\n- Agent 3: Hunt the exact 52,675 bytes in padding, metadata, and artifacts\n- Agent 7: Deep PE analysis - compare section headers, offsets, alignments\n- Agent 9: Enhanced Machine compilation with precise padding and metadata\n- Agent 10: Binary diff at byte level to locate missing 52,675 bytes exactly\n- Agent 15: Monitor each byte recovered toward 5,267,456 target\n\nCONTINUOUS TARGETING UNTIL 100% ACHIEVED:\n- Identify which of the 52,675 bytes are in each category\n- Apply surgical fixes to PE structure, padding, metadata\n- Re-run compilation with enhanced precision algorithms\n- Verify each byte added moves closer to perfect match\n- NEVER STOP until exact 5,267,456 byte match with identical hash\n\nZERO TOLERANCE: Only 100% functional identity is acceptable.",
