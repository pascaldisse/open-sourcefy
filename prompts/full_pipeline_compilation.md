# Full Pipeline Execution and Compilation Fixing Prompt

## Objective
Execute the complete open-sourcefy pipeline from start to finish and systematically fix all issues that prevent successful compilation of the reconstructed source code. This is an end-to-end workflow prompt that ensures the entire system works as intended.

## CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
⚠️ **ALL OUTPUT MUST GO TO `/output` DIRECTORY ONLY** ⚠️
- NO files should be created outside of `/output/` or its subdirectories
- NO temporary files in project root, working directory, or `/tmp`
- ALL pipeline results, compilation artifacts, logs MUST be in `/output/`
- Use structured subdirectories: agents/, ghidra/, compilation/, reports/, logs/, temp/
- Ensure all file operations respect the `/output/` boundary

## Pipeline Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Complete Pipeline Execution
Run the full 15-agent pipeline and capture all failures, errors, and issues that occur during execution.

#### 1.1 Initial Pipeline Run

**🤖 AUTOMATION AVAILABLE**: Use the pipeline helper script for automated execution and monitoring.

```bash
# AUTOMATED: Use pipeline helper for full execution
./scripts/pipeline_helper.py validate-env  # First validate environment
./scripts/pipeline_helper.py run launcher.exe --mode full --debug

# MANUAL: Direct execution (if automation not available)
python main.py launcher.exe --output-dir full_pipeline_test --debug --log-level DEBUG

# Expected output structure:
# full_pipeline_test/
# ├── agents/          # All 15 agent results
# ├── ghidra/          # Ghidra decompilation outputs
# ├── compilation/     # Generated source code and build files
# ├── reports/         # Pipeline execution reports
# ├── logs/           # Detailed execution logs
# └── temp/           # Temporary analysis files
```

#### 1.2 Comprehensive Error Collection
Document all issues encountered during pipeline execution:

**Agent-Level Issues**:
- NotImplementedError exceptions
- Import/dependency failures
- File I/O and path resolution errors
- Timeout and resource exhaustion
- Data format and parsing errors

**Integration Issues**:
- Context passing failures between agents
- Dependency resolution problems
- Result format inconsistencies
- Resource conflicts and cleanup issues

**Tool Integration Issues**:
- Ghidra installation and path detection
- Headless mode execution failures
- Script generation and execution errors
- Result parsing and validation failures

### Phase 2: Systematic Issue Resolution

#### 2.1 Priority-Based Fixing Approach

**Priority 1: Pipeline Blocking Issues (Fix First)**
These issues prevent the pipeline from completing:

```python
# Agent dependency failures that break the pipeline
Agent 1 (BinaryDiscovery): Binary format detection failures
Agent 2 (ArchAnalysis): Architecture detection errors  
Agent 5 (BinaryStructure): Critical parsing failures
Agent 7 (AdvancedDecompiler): Ghidra integration failures
Agent 12 (CompilationOrchestrator): Build system generation failures

# Fix approach:
1. Implement minimal viable functionality for each blocking issue
2. Add proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. Ensure graceful degradation when features are incomplete
4. Validate that pipeline continues even with partial failures
```

**Priority 2: Quality-Critical Issues (Fix Second)**
These issues affect the quality of reconstructed code:

```python
# Issues that impact compilation success
Agent 11 (GlobalReconstructor): Code organization and header generation
Agent 13 (FinalValidator): Validation and quality checks
Agent 6 (OptimizationMatcher): Optimization detection and reversal
Agent 9 (AdvancedAssembly): Assembly analysis accuracy

# Fix approach:
1. Implement core functionality for code reconstruction
2. Add syntax validation and correction
3. Improve function signature inference
4. Enhance type inference and variable naming
```

**Priority 3: Enhancement Issues (Fix Last)**
These issues improve analysis depth but don't block compilation:

```python
# Advanced analysis features
Agent 8 (BinaryDiff): Binary comparison and analysis
Agent 10 (ResourceReconstructor): Resource extraction and reconstruction
Agent 14 (AdvancedGhidra): Enhanced Ghidra analysis
Agent 15 (MetadataAnalysis): Comprehensive metadata extraction

# Fix approach:
1. Implement basic functionality
2. Add advanced features incrementally
3. Focus on features that improve compilation success
4. Add comprehensive testing and validation
```

#### 2.2 Implementation Workflow

**Step 1: Agent-by-Agent Implementation**
For each agent with NotImplementedError or dummy code:

```python
# Analysis approach for each agent:
1. Run agent individually to isolate failures
   python -m src.core.agents.agent01_binary_discovery launcher.exe

2. Identify specific NotImplementedError functions
   # Example from Agent 7:
   - _enhance_function_signature()
   - _identify_local_variables() 
   - _analyze_function_complexity()
   - _reconstruct_data_structures()

3. Implement with real functionality:
   # Replace dummy implementations with working code
   # Add proper error handling and validation
   # Include comprehensive logging and debugging

4. Test agent functionality:
   # Verify agent produces valid output
   # Check integration with dependent agents
   # Validate output format and structure
```

**Step 2: Integration Testing**
After fixing individual agents:

```python
# Progressive pipeline testing
1. Test agent subsets (1-5, 1-10, full pipeline)
2. Validate context flow between agents
3. Check result aggregation and processing
4. Verify output structure and completeness

# Integration validation checklist:
- [ ] All agents complete without NotImplementedError
- [ ] Context data flows correctly between agents
- [ ] Agent results are properly formatted and accessible
- [ ] No critical data is lost during processing
- [ ] Error handling works across agent boundaries
```

**Step 3: Compilation Testing**
Focus on getting the generated code to compile successfully:

```python
# Compilation validation workflow
1. Check generated source code structure:
   # Verify all source files are created
   # Check header file generation and inclusion
   # Validate function declarations and definitions
   # Ensure proper C/C++ syntax

2. Test build system generation:
   # CMake files are properly formatted
   # MSBuild projects include all source files
   # Dependency linking is correctly configured
   # Build configurations are valid

3. Attempt compilation:
   # Windows: MSBuild or cl.exe
   cd compilation && msbuild launcher-new.sln
   
   # Linux/macOS: CMake + Make or GCC
   cd compilation && cmake . && make
   
   # Alternative: Direct compilation
   gcc -I include src/*.c -o reconstructed_binary

4. Fix compilation errors systematically:
   # Syntax errors: Fix C/C++ syntax issues
   # Missing declarations: Add function prototypes
   # Type mismatches: Correct variable types
   # Linking errors: Add missing libraries
```

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance and Validation

#### 3.1 Compilation Success Metrics
Establish clear criteria for successful compilation:

```python
# Success criteria definition
COMPILATION_SUCCESS_CRITERIA = {
    "syntax_errors": 0,           # No C/C++ syntax errors
    "missing_declarations": 0,    # All functions declared
    "type_errors": 0,            # Correct variable types
    "linking_errors": 0,         # All dependencies resolved
    "warnings": "acceptable",    # Allow reasonable warnings
    "executable_generated": True  # Binary successfully created
}

# Quality assessment metrics
QUALITY_METRICS = {
    "function_reconstruction_rate": ">70%",  # Functions properly reconstructed
    "variable_naming_quality": ">60%",       # Meaningful variable names
    "code_organization": ">50%",             # Logical code structure
    "resource_extraction": ">80%",          # Resources properly extracted
    "build_system_accuracy": ">90%"         # Build files work correctly
}
```

#### 3.2 Comprehensive Testing Framework
Implement systematic testing to ensure reliability:

```python
# Automated testing pipeline
def run_comprehensive_tests():
    """Execute complete testing workflow"""
    
    # 1. Pipeline health check
    pipeline_health = test_pipeline_health()
    
    # 2. Agent functionality tests
    agent_results = test_all_agents()
    
    # 3. Integration tests
    integration_results = test_agent_integration()
    
    # 4. Compilation tests
    compilation_results = test_compilation_pipeline()
    
    # 5. Quality assessment
    quality_scores = assess_output_quality()
    
    # 6. Performance validation
    performance_metrics = test_performance()
    
    return {
        "pipeline_health": pipeline_health,
        "agent_functionality": agent_results,
        "integration": integration_results,
        "compilation": compilation_results,
        "quality": quality_scores,
        "performance": performance_metrics
    }

# Test execution framework
def test_with_multiple_binaries():
    """Test pipeline with various binary types"""
    test_binaries = [
        "simple_console_app.exe",    # Basic console application
        "gui_application.exe",       # Windows GUI application
        "library_example.dll",       # Dynamic library
        "linux_binary",              # Linux ELF binary
        "complex_application.exe"    # Large, complex application
    ]
    
    results = {}
    for binary in test_binaries:
        try:
            results[binary] = run_pipeline_test(binary)
        except Exception as e:
            results[binary] = {"error": str(e), "status": "failed"}
    
    return results
```

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization and Production Readiness

#### 4.1 Performance Monitoring and Optimization
Ensure the pipeline runs efficiently:

```python
# Performance monitoring framework
def monitor_pipeline_performance():
    """Monitor resource usage during pipeline execution"""
    
    metrics = {
        "execution_time": {},      # Time per agent and total
        "memory_usage": {},        # Peak memory usage
        "disk_usage": {},         # Temporary file usage
        "cpu_usage": {},          # CPU utilization
        "ghidra_performance": {}   # Ghidra-specific metrics
    }
    
    # Performance optimization targets
    PERFORMANCE_TARGETS = {
        "total_execution_time": "<300s",    # 5 minutes for typical binary
        "peak_memory_usage": "<2GB",        # Reasonable memory limit
        "disk_space_usage": "<1GB",         # Temporary file limit
        "agent_failure_rate": "<5%",        # High reliability
        "compilation_success_rate": ">80%"  # High success rate
    }

# Resource optimization strategies
def optimize_pipeline_performance():
    """Apply performance optimizations"""
    
    # 1. Parallel agent execution where possible
    # 2. Efficient memory management and cleanup
    # 3. Optimized Ghidra script generation
    # 4. Caching of intermediate results
    # 5. Streaming processing for large binaries
```

#### 4.2 Error Recovery and Resilience
Build robust error handling throughout the pipeline:

```python
# Comprehensive error recovery framework
def implement_error_recovery():
    """Add robust error handling and recovery"""
    
    # Agent-level recovery
    def execute_agent_with_recovery(agent, context):
        try:
            return agent.execute(context)
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Use fallback implementation
            return agent.execute_fallback(context)
        except Exception as e:
            # Attempt graceful degradation
            return agent.execute_minimal(context)
    
    # Pipeline-level recovery
    def recover_pipeline_execution(pipeline_state, failed_agent):
        """Recover from agent failures and continue pipeline"""
        
        # Options:
        # 1. Skip agent and continue with warning
        # 2. Use cached result if available
        # 3. Use simplified fallback implementation
        # 4. Abort pipeline with detailed error report
    
    # Build system recovery
    def recover_compilation_failures(compilation_errors):
        """Attempt to fix common compilation issues"""
        
        fixes = {
            "missing_headers": add_missing_includes,
            "undefined_functions": add_function_stubs,
            "type_errors": fix_type_mismatches,
            "linking_errors": add_missing_libraries
        }
        
        for error_type, fix_function in fixes.items():
            if error_type in compilation_errors:
                fix_function(compilation_errors[error_type])
```
