# Open-Sourcefy Codebase Refactor Plan

## Overview
Complete refactoring to reduce boilerplate, eliminate hardcoded values, optimize to exactly 16 agents, and maximize parallelization.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis (Immediate Start)
**Goal**: Establish refactoring foundation and analyze current state

### 1.1 Current State Analysis

- [ ] Map agent dependencies and execution order
- [ ] Document hardcoded values across codebase

### 1.2 Agent Consolidation Planning
- [ ] Group similar functionality agents for merging
- [ ] Design 16-agent architecture with logical naming

## Phase 3: Configuration & Environment (Parallel with Phase 2)
**Goal**: Replace all hardcoded values with configurable system

### 3.1 Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create `.env.template` with all required variables
- [ ] Implement `ConfigManager` class for centralized config
- [ ] Replace hardcoded paths with environment variables
- [ ] Replace hardcoded timeouts, limits, and thresholds

### 3.2 Dynamic Path Resolution
- [ ] Implement smart Ghidra path detection
- [ ] Dynamic output directory structure creation
- [ ] Configurable tool paths (compilers, analyzers)
- [ ] Runtime environment detection and adaptation

### 3.3 Settings Management
- [ ] User-configurable analysis parameters
- [ ] Agent execution settings and priorities
- [ ] Performance tuning parameters
- [ ] Debug and logging level configuration

## Phase 4: Pipeline & Performance (After Phases 1-3)
**Goal**: Optimize execution pipeline and finalize system

### 4.1 Parallel Execution Engine
- [ ] Enhanced parallel executor with dependency management
- [ ] Agent scheduling based on dependency graph
- [ ] Resource management and throttling
- [ ] Failure recovery and retry mechanisms

### 4.2 Pipeline Optimization
- [ ] Minimize sequential dependencies (only Agent01 as gate)
- [ ] Implement result caching and reuse
- [ ] Optimize memory usage and cleanup
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics

### 4.3 Integration & Testing
- [ ] Update main.py for new agent structure
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all 16 agents
- [ ] Validation of parallel execution
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Key Refactoring Principles

### Code Reduction Strategies
- Eliminate duplicate error handling patterns
- Shared logging and progress tracking
- Common file operations and path handling
- Unified configuration and environment management
- Shared validation and verification logic

### Configuration-Driven Design
- All paths configurable via environment variables
- All timeouts, limits, and thresholds configurable
- Agent execution parameters externalized
- Tool paths and versions configurable

### Parallelization Optimization
- Minimize dependencies between agents
- Only Agent01 as mandatory sequential gate
- Independent data processing where possible
- Shared context for inter-agent communication

### Quality Improvements
- Consistent error handling across all agents
- Comprehensive logging and debugging
- Robust failure recovery mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Codebase size reduced by 40%+
- [ ] Agent count exactly 16
- [ ] 15 agents can run in parallel after Agent01
- [ ] Zero hardcoded paths or values
- [ ] All configuration externalized
- [ ] Execution time improved by 25%+
- [ ] Code maintainability significantly improved

## Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1** (Foundation): Start immediately
2. **Phase 2** (Agents): Start after Phase 1.2 complete
3. **Phase 3** (Config): Start in parallel with Phase 2
4. **Phase 4** (Pipeline): Start after Phases 1-3 complete

Each phase builds on previous phases but allows for parallel development where dependencies permit.
