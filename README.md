# Open-Sourcefy

**Advanced AI-Powered Binary Decompilation & Reconstruction System**

Open-Sourcefy is a sophisticated reverse engineering framework designed to reconstruct compilable source code from binary executables through intelligent decompilation and multi-agent analysis.

## Overview

This project implements a **Matrix-themed AI pipeline** with **Ghidra integration** and **LangChain-based agent framework** to transform binary executables back into readable, compilable C source code. The system features production-ready architecture with **4 core agents currently implemented** (Phase 2 complete) with expansion to 16 agents planned. Primary test target: **Matrix Online launcher.exe** binary.

### Key Features

- **🤖 Matrix Agent Pipeline**: 4 production-ready agents implemented (Phase 2 complete)
- **🧠 LangChain AI Integration**: Advanced AI-enhanced analysis with fail-fast validation
- **🔍 Multi-Format Support**: PE/ELF/Mach-O binary analysis with Ghidra integration
- **⚡ Production Architecture**: SOLID principles, zero hardcoded values, comprehensive logging
- **🔄 Fail-Fast Validation**: Quality thresholds (75%) with early termination on failure
- **📊 Advanced Analysis**: Compiler detection, optimization patterns, structural analysis
- **🔧 Clean Codebase**: Shared components, Matrix error handling, configuration-driven design

## Architecture

### Pipeline Stages

The system operates through a Matrix-themed production pipeline with fail-fast validation:

1. **Foundation Phase** (Agent 1): Sentinel - Binary discovery, metadata analysis, security scanning
2. **Core Analysis Phase** (Agents 2-4): Parallel execution of Architect, Merovingian, Agent Smith
3. **Quality Validation**: Fail-fast validation with 75% quality thresholds at each stage
4. **Shared Memory**: Context sharing between agents through structured data exchange
5. **Future Expansion**: Framework ready for Agents 5-16 implementation
