# Open-Sourcefy

**Advanced AI-Powered Binary Decompilation & Reconstruction System**

Open-Sourcefy is a sophisticated reverse engineering framework designed to reconstruct compilable source code from binary executables through intelligent decompilation and multi-agent analysis.

## Overview

This project implements a **16-agent Matrix-themed AI pipeline** with **Ghidra integration** and **LangChain-based agent framework** to transform binary executables back into readable, compilable C source code. The system follows a master-first parallel execution model with the **Matrix Online launcher.exe** binary as a primary test case.

### Key Features

- **🤖 16-Agent Matrix Pipeline**: Matrix-themed agents with master-first parallel execution model
- **🧠 LangChain Agent Framework**: Advanced AI agent orchestration with conversation management
- **🔍 Ghidra Integration**: Automated headless decompilation with custom script support
- **⚡ Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded and multi-process execution modes
- **🔄 Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms and robust error handling
- **📊 Comprehensive Analysis**: Binary structure, optimization patterns, and resource reconstruction
- **🔧 Structured Output**: Organized output directory structure with detailed reports

## Architecture

### Pipeline Stages

The system operates through a Matrix-themed master-first parallel execution model:

1. **Master Orchestrator** (Agent 0): Deus Ex Machina - Central coordination and task distribution
2. **Parallel Execution Phase** (Agents 1-16): 16 specialized Matrix characters executing in parallel
3. **Result Aggregation**: Master agent collects and synthesizes results from all parallel agents
4. **Quality Assessment**: Comprehensive validation and optimization of final output

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Full Matrix pipeline with master-first execution
python main.py launcher.exe

# Master agent only (coordination and planning)
python main.py launcher.exe --agent 0

# Specific Matrix agents (when implemented)
python main.py launcher.exe --agent 1           # Sentinel
python main.py launcher.exe --agents 1-5        # Phase B agents

# Parallel execution with batch processing
python main.py launcher.exe --batch-size 8 --parallel-mode process
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Enhanced timeout and retry configuration
python main.py launcher.exe --timeout 1800 --max-retries 5

# Master-first parallel processing with Matrix agents
python main.py launcher.exe --parallel-mode process --batch-size 16

# LangChain agent configuration
python main.py launcher.exe --enable-langchain --conversation-mode

# Environment validation and health monitoring
python main.py --verify-env --detailed

# Phase-based execution (when agents are implemented)
python main.py launcher.exe --agents 1-8   # Phase B agents
python main.py launcher.exe --agents 9-16  # Phase C agents
```
